# Collection of all Unicode emoji characters for your reference and use

# 👋👋🏻👋🏼 Hello! 👋🏽👋🏾👋🏿

[This](All-official-Unicode-emoji-characters-grouped-by-category.md) 👈🏼 is a reference to *ALL* emoji characters that are defined in the Unicode standard for use everywhere. This reference is really helpful to look up emojis to express different things on GitHub, emails and beyond. 

Having it here on GitHub is super useful because every emoji looks **different** on every system! They look one way on iPhones, another way on Android, another on the desktop in a browser on MacOS, and still another way in Windows!

⭐ **Star this repo**, and you can come back to it on any platform you are interested in, to see what all of the emoji's you are using or are considering to use look like. The emoji images created by the different companies for use in their products sometimes look vastly different from the same emoji on another product, and this difference has been known to cause confusion and problems!

**All** emoji Unicode characters are here, gathered from the **official Unicode standards site**, then put in Markdown format and grouped by category and by subgroup.

Be sure to ⭐ **star this repo** so you can find it again! That'll help you to find it to look ip emojis in the future.

Thanks! I hope this reference is useful for you. 👍👍🏻👍🏼👍🏽👍🏾👍🏿
